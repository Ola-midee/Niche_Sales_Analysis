    Sales, Shifts, and Sandwiches: The Story Behind the Numbers

When we think of data, we often imagine numbers on spreadsheets. But behind those numbers are stories — of people, patterns, and business decisions. That’s exactly what I discovered while building this Niche Store Sales Analysis dashboard on Tableau 

Here’s what the data revealed:
 Sales Over the Years
There was a sharp dip from $195.6K in 2022 to $79.7K in 2023. Was it due to market shifts, reduced marketing, or changing customer behavior? These are the kinds of questions this dashboard invites.

When Do We Buy?
Turns out, Night-time is prime time, raking in $62.1K, followed by the Afternoon and Morning slots. Midnight snacks? Not so popular at $50.7K.

Sales by Gender
Male employees slightly edged out female counterparts in total sales, but both contributed impressively — $143.4K vs. $131.8K. Team effort matters.

 What Are We Eating?
Sandwiches are the MVP, leading with $65.8K, followed by Frankies and Cold Coffee. Beverages like Sugarcane Juice did well too, but some items like Vada Pav and Aalopuri had relatively lower sales.

Monthly Trends
April and June saw noticeable dips ($17.7K and $17.3K), while January, October, and May brought stronger numbers. Seasonal trends? Possibly. Promotion periods? Maybe. This sets the stage for further exploration.

This dashboard was more than just a practice in PowerBi — it was a chance to uncover real business insights and rediscover how data tells human stories.
